# Tools and Technologies
We’ll explore how to set up an end-to-end data engineering project using a suite of Azure services, integrating dbt for efficient data transformations. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each component and its role in our project:

Cloud Provider — Azure: Azure will be our foundational cloud platform, providing a robust and scalable environment for all our data operations. Azure’s wide array of services and tools offers a cohesive ecosystem, ensuring seamless integration and management of our data pipeline components.

Database — Azure SQL: We will utilize Azure SQL, the cloud-based version of Microsoft SQL Server, as our primary database system. This choice brings the reliability and familiarity of SQL Server into a flexible, cloud-native environment. For demonstration purposes, we’ll employ the AdventureWorks LT sample database, which provides a rich dataset for various transformation scenarios.

Azure Data Lake: As a central repository for our large-scale data storage and analytics, Azure Data Lake will play a crucial role. It offers a secure, scalable, and cost-effective storage solution, capable of handling massive volumes of structured and unstructured data. This will be instrumental in storing raw data, intermediate results, and final outputs in various formats.

Azure Key Vault: Security and confidentiality are paramount in data engineering projects. Azure Key Vault will be used to securely store and manage sensitive information such as keys, secrets, and certificates. This ensures that our data pipeline maintains high security standards, protecting access to databases, data lakes, and other critical resources.

Azure Databricks: For powerful data processing and analytics, we’ll leverage Azure Databricks. This Apache Spark-based analytics service provides an optimized environment for big data processing and machine learning. It’s instrumental for handling complex data transformation and analysis tasks, offering both performance and ease of use.

Azure Data Factory: As our primary data integration tool, Azure Data Factory will orchestrate and automate the movement and transformation of data. It’s a key component for building data pipelines, allowing us to efficiently manage data flows between various Azure services and external data sources.

dbt (Data Build Tool): dbt will be a key player in our data transformation strategy. It allows for the creation and management of data transformation workflows using familiar SQL syntax. dbt fits seamlessly into our architecture, particularly in the transformation phase, where it can be used to model data, run tests, and generate documentation. This makes it easier for teams, especially those proficient in SQL, to contribute to the data transformation process, ensuring that business logic is consistently applied and documented. Integrating dbt with Azure SQL and Azure Data Lake enhances our ability to manage and transform data efficiently, while maintaining clarity and consistency across the entire pipeline.

# Setting up the stage on Azure Cloud
Getting started with Azure is pretty easy, as they offer free 12 months access to over 55+ services. You can get started by creating a free account. Once that is created, you only need to sign in with your credentials and you will have access to the landing page.

# Setting up the resource groups
Setting up resource groups in Azure is a fundamental step in organizing and managing your Azure resources efficiently. A resource group in Azure is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. Once logged in, find the “Resource groups” option in the navigation pane on the left-hand side or list of services. If it’s not visible, use the search bar at the top to search for “Resource groups”, fill in the required details and once the deployment is complete, you can navigate to the resource group and start adding resources like Azure SQL databases, Azure Data Lake storage accounts, etc.

Given our use case and chosen approach, I will set up the necessary containers to support the implementation of the medallion architecture.

We will then create containers for the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

### Setting Up Azure Data Factory

Azure Data Factory (ADF) enables you to build a data integration solution for creating, scheduling, and orchestrating ETL/ELT workflows. To get started, go to the Azure Portal and search for “Data Factory” using the top search bar or locate it in the navigation menu. Enter the required details, select **Review + Create**, and complete the deployment.

Once deployment is finished, open the Data Factory resource by clicking **Go to resource** or selecting it from your resource list. From the overview page, click on the **Author & Monitor** option to launch Azure Data Factory Studio. This is where you can begin designing and managing your data integration pipelines.

### Setting Up Azure Key Vault
Azure Key Vault is used to securely store and manage cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates required by cloud applications and services. To set it up, go to the Azure Portal and search for “Key Vault” using the search bar or locate it in the navigation menu. Complete the required configuration and deploy the resource.

Once the deployment is complete, open the Key Vault resource. From there, you can begin adding secrets (such as database connection strings), keys (for encryption and decryption), and certificates. You can also configure access policies to control which users or Azure services have permission to access the vault.

### Creating SQL Database and Loading Sample Data
Next, we’ll set up an Azure SQL Database and populate it with the AdventureWorks sample data. In the Azure Portal, search for “SQL Databases” using the search bar or access it through the navigation pane. If you don’t already have an SQL server, you can create one by selecting **Create New** next to the server dropdown in the database configuration section.

Under the **Additional Settings** tab, choose the sample database option in the existing data section to load the AdventureWorks LT dataset. After that, proceed with the default steps by clicking **Next** and then **Review + Create** to complete the setup.

### Data Integration with Azure Data Factory
After completing the setup, the next step is to begin building pipelines in Azure Data Factory. You can do this by returning to the ADF Studio page or by searching for “Data Factory” in the top search bar and opening the resource.


### Connecting ADF to Azure SQL Database
The connection between Azure Data Factory (ADF) and the SQL database is established using a linked service. To access this, go to the **Manage** section in the sidebar, then select **Linked Services** under Connections and click **+ New**. Provide the database details and authentication credentials, then test the connection to confirm it has been successfully established.
